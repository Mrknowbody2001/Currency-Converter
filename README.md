# Currency Converter

**Currency Converter** is a web application that allows users to easily convert currencies and retrieve the latest exchange rates. The app features two modes: a currency conversion mode and an exchange rate listing mode, with a seamless toggle system between the two modes, making the application both versatile and user-friendly.

## Key Features
- **Currency Conversion**: Users can input an amount, select a source currency and target currency, and convert the amount in real-time using up-to-date exchange rates.
- **Live Exchange Rates**: Users can fetch and view the latest exchange rates for a selected base currency.
- **Interactive UI**: The application has a clean, responsive user interface with clear labels and buttons to ensure smooth navigation.
- **Toggle Mode**: Switch effortlessly between currency conversion and viewing exchange rates with a button toggle system.
- **Scroll Feature for Exchange Rates**: The exchange rate list is scrollable, enhancing the user experience when viewing multiple currencies.

## Technologies Used
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Used for handling real-time API requests and responses.
- **Fetch API**: Makes HTTP requests to retrieve conversion rates and exchange rate data from a third-party API.
- **HTML**: Structures the content and layout of the web app.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for a visually appealing and responsive design, including toggle buttons, scrollable lists, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the app's logic, such as fetching data from the exchange rate API, switching modes, and dynamically updating the UI.

## Issues
- After switching to the exchange rate section and then returning to the conversion section using the toggle, the convert section doesn't appear exactly as it did initially. This behavior needs to be fixed, and an update is expected in the next few days.
